               4,[5],12:i:-) is a monophasic variant of Salmonella Typhimurium
               that has emerged as a global cause of multidrug resistant
               salmonellosis. We used Bayesian phylodynamics, genomic
               epidemiology, and phenotypic characterization to describe the
               emergence and evolution of Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- in Australia.
               We show that the interruption of the genetic region surrounding
               the phase II flagellin, FljB, causing a monophasic phenotype,
               represents a stepwise evolutionary event through the
               accumulation of mobile resistance elements with minimal
               impairment to bacterial fitness. We identify three lineages with
               different population dynamics and discrete antimicrobial
               resistance profiles emerged, likely reflecting differential
               antimicrobial selection pressures. Two lineages are associated

               (SNPs) are a cornerstone of genomic approaches to the inference
               of transmission of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms in
               hospitals. However, the impact of many key analytical approaches
               on these inferences has not yet been systematically assessed.
               This study aims to make such a systematic assessment. Methods We
               conducted a 15-month prospective study (2-month pilot phase,
               13-month implementation phase), across four hospital networks
               including eight hospitals in Melbourne, VIC, Australia. Patient
               clinical and screening samples containing one or more isolates
               of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,
               vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and extended-spectrum
               $\beta$-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella
               pneumoniae were collected and underwent whole genome sequencing.
               Using the genome data from the top four most numerous sequence
               types from each species, 16 in total, we systematically assessed
               the: (1) impact of sample and reference genome diversity through
               multiple core genome alignments using different data subsets and
               reference genomes, (2) effect of masking of prophage and regions
               of recombination in the core genome alignments by assessing SNP
               distances before and after masking, (3) differences between a
               cumulative versus a 3-month sliding-window approach to sample
               genome inclusion in the dataset over time, and (4) the
               comparative effects each of these approaches had when applying a
               previously defined SNP threshold for inferring likely
               transmission. Findings 2275 samples were collected (397 during
               the pilot phase from April 4 to June 18, 2017; 1878 during the
               implementation phase from Oct 30, 2017, to Nov 30, 2018) from
               1870 patients. Of these 2275 samples, 1537 were identified as
               arising from the four most numerous sequence types from each of
               the four target species of MDR organisms in this dataset (16
               sequence types in total: S aureus ST5, ST22, ST45, and ST93; E
               faecium ST80, ST203, ST1421, and ST1424; K pneumoniae ST15,
               ST17, ST307, and ST323; and E coli ST38, ST131, ST648, and
               ST1193). Across the species, using a reference genome of the
               same sequence type provided a greater degree of pairwise SNP
               resolution, compared with species and outgroup-reference
               alignments that mostly resulted in inflated SNP distances and
               the possibility of missed transmission events. Omitting prophage
               regions had minimal effect; however, omitting recombination
               regions had a highly variable effect, often inflating the number
               of closely related pairs. Estimated SNP distances between
               isolate pairs over time were more consistent using a
               sliding-window than a cumulative approach. Interpretation We
               propose that the use of a closely related reference genome,
               without masking of prophage or recombination regions, and of a
               sliding-window approach for isolate inclusion is best for
               accurate and consistent MDR organism transmission inference,
               when using core genome alignments and SNP thresholds. These
               approaches provide increased stability and resolution, so SNP
               thresholds can be more reliably applied for putative
               transmission inference among diverse MDR organisms, reducing the
               chance of incorrectly inferring the presence or absence of close
               genetic relatedness and, therefore, transmission. The
               establishment of a broadly applicable and standardised approach,
               as proposed here, is necessary to implement widespread
               prospective genomic surveillance for MDR organism transmission.

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: A cornerstone of Australia's ability to control
               COVID-19 has been effective border control with an extensive
               supervised quarantine programme. However, a rapid recrudescence
               of COVID-19 was observed in the state of Victoria in June, 2020.
               We aim to describe the genomic findings that located the source
               of this second wave and show the role of genomic epidemiology in
               the successful elimination of COVID-19 for a second time in
               Australia. METHODS: In this observational, genomic
               epidemiological study, we did genomic sequencing of all
               laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in Victoria,
               Australia between Jan 25, 2020, and Jan 31, 2021. We did
               phylogenetic analyses, genomic cluster discovery, and integrated
               results with epidemiological data (detailed information on
               demographics, risk factors, and exposure) collected via
               interview by the Victorian Government Department of Health.
               Genomic transmission networks were used to group multiple
               genomic clusters when epidemiological and genomic data suggested
               they arose from a single importation event and diversified
               within Victoria. To identify transmission of emergent lineages
               between Victoria and other states or territories in Australia,
               all publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences uploaded before Feb
               11, 2021, were obtained from the national sequence sharing
               programme AusTrakka, and epidemiological data were obtained from
               the submitting laboratories. We did phylodynamic analyses to
               estimate the growth rate, doubling time, and number of days from
               the first local infection to the collection of the first
               sequenced genome for the dominant local cluster, and compared
               our growth estimates to previously published estimates from a
               similar growth phase of lineage B.1.1.7 (also known as the Alpha
               variant) in the UK. FINDINGS: Between Jan 25, 2020, and Jan 31,
               2021, there were 20 451 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19
               in Victoria, Australia, of which 15 431 were submitted for
               sequencing, and 11 711 met all quality control metrics and were
               included in our analysis. We identified 595 genomic clusters,
               with a median of five cases per cluster (IQR 2-11). Overall,
               samples from 11 503 (98·2\%) of 11 711 cases clustered with
               another sample in Victoria, either within a genomic cluster or
               transmission network. Genomic analysis revealed that 10 426
               cases, including 10 416 (98·4\%) of 10 584 locally acquired
               cases, diagnosed during the second wave (between June and
               October, 2020) were derived from a single incursion from hotel
               quarantine, with the outbreak lineage (transmission network G,
               lineage D.2) rapidly detected in other Australian states and
               territories. Phylodynamic analyses indicated that the epidemic
               growth rate of the outbreak lineage in Victoria during the
               initial growth phase (samples collected between June 4 and July
               9, 2020; 47·4 putative transmission events, per branch, per year
               [1/years; 95\% credible interval 26·0-85·0]), was similar to
               that of other reported variants, such as B.1.1.7 in the UK (mean
               approximately 71·5 1/years). Strict interventions were
               implemented, and the outbreak lineage has not been detected in
               Australia since Oct 29, 2020. Subsequent cases represented
               independent international or interstate introductions, with
               limited local spread. INTERPRETATION: Our study highlights how
               rapid escalation of clonal outbreaks can occur from a single
               incursion. However, strict quarantine measures and decisive
               public health responses to emergent cases are effective, even
               with high epidemic growth rates. Real-time genomic surveillance
               can alter the way in which public health agencies view and
               respond to COVID-19 outbreaks. FUNDING: The Victorian

               systems worldwide and has the potential to make significant
               contributions to infectious disease surveillance, outbreak
               investigation and infection prevention and control. However, to
               date, there are limited data regarding (i) the optimal models
               for integration of genomic data into epidemiological
               investigations and (ii) how to quantify and evaluate public
               health impacts resulting from genomic epidemiological
               investigations. METHODS: We developed the Pathogen Genomics in
               Public HeAlth Surveillance Evaluation (PG-PHASE) Framework to
               guide examination of the use of WGS in public health
               surveillance and disease control. We illustrate the use of this
               framework with three pathogens as case studies: Listeria
               monocytogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2.
               RESULTS: The framework utilises an adaptable whole-of-system
               approach towards understanding how interconnected elements in
               the public health application of pathogen genomics contribute to
               public health processes and outcomes. The three phases of the
               PG-PHASE Framework are designed to support understanding of WGS
               laboratory processes, analysis, reporting and data sharing, and
               how genomic data are utilised in public health practice across
               all stages, from the decision to send an isolate or sample for
               sequencing to the use of sequence data in public health
               surveillance, investigation and decision-making. Importantly,
               the phases can be used separately or in conjunction, depending
               on the need of the evaluator. Subsequent to conducting
               evaluation underpinned by the framework, avenues may be
               developed for strategic investment or interventions to improve
               utilisation of whole genome sequencing. CONCLUSIONS:
               Comprehensive evaluation is critical to support health
               departments, public health laboratories and other stakeholders
               to successfully incorporate microbial genomics into public
               health practice. The PG-PHASE Framework aims to assist public
               health laboratories, health departments and authorities who are
               either considering transitioning to whole genome sequencing or
               intending to assess the integration of WGS in public health
               practice, including the capacity to detect and respond to
               outbreaks and associated costs, challenges and facilitators in

               current state of genomics in clinical microbiology and public

               deployed in December 2015 across Victoria, Australia (population
               6.5 million). METHODS: A prospective multi-modal intervention
               including active screening, carrier isolation, centralised case
               investigation and comparative pathogen genomics was implemented.
               We analyze trend in CPE incidence and clinical presentation,
               risk factors and local transmission over the program's first
               three years (January 2016 to December 2018). RESULTS: CPE case
               ascertainment increased over the study period to 1.42
               cases/100,000 population, linked to increased screening without

               referral and initial genomic and epidemiological assessment for
               local transmission was 11 days (IQR 9-14). Prospective

  abstract  = "Abstract The accurate identification of conservation units is
               central to effective management strategies. However, marine
               environment populations often have large census sizes and few
               obvious boundaries to gene flow. Poorly understood species in
               the deep sea are especially at risk of being erroneously managed
               as a single interbreeding stock (panmictic). However, mistaking
               cryptic structure for panmixia can have important consequences
               leading to ineffective management and population decline.
               Furthermore, characteristics of populations essential for their
               survival may reflect local adaptation, not evident from surveys
               using neutral genetic markers. We use genomic methodologies to
               test hypotheses about potential drivers of cryptic population
               structure among marine fish populations in the deep sea. In
               particular, we consider the possibility of isolation by distance
               along habitat corridors for a species dependent on a specific
               depth range and test for differentiation at functional loci
               across potential ecological habitat boundaries. For a species
               previously understood to be panmictic in the North Atlantic, we
               reveal neutral genetic differentiation among regional
               populations isolated by distance along deep-water channels. We
               also reveal a distinct pattern of cryptic genetic structure for
               putative functional loci, despite apparently high levels of gene
               flow. Synthesis and applications. This example reflects the life
               history and ecology of a broad range of deep-sea species
               currently exploited in intensive fisheries or as bycatch. In
               many cases where these populations are managed as a single
               stock, more effective management could be achieved using the
               methods we describe to identify relevant eco-evolutionary
               processes, facilitated by genomic methods, permitting the
               recognition of cryptic stock structure. This approach also

               analyses and the data were then combined with epidemiological
               data. Trial registration (main trial): ClinicalTrials.gov
               Identifier NCT01800942. RESULTS: Seven S. aureus STs were
               identified, with ST5 dominant (n = 40, 61.0\%), followed by ST15
               (n = 11, 17.0\%). ST5 predominated in the placebo arm (73.0\%
               versus 49.0\%, P = 0.039) and ST15 in the azithromycin arm
               (27.0\% versus 6.0\%, P = 0.022). In azithromycin-resistant
               isolates, msr(A) was the main macrolide resistance gene (n = 36,
               80\%). Ten study participants, from both trial arms, acquired
               azithromycin-resistant S. aureus after initially harbouring a
               susceptible isolate. In nine (90\%) of these cases, the acquired
               clone was an msr(A)-containing ST5 S. aureus. Long-read
               sequencing demonstrated that in ST5, msr(A) was found on an MDR
               plasmid. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal in this Gambian population
               the presence of a dominant clone of S. aureus harbouring
               plasmid-encoded azithromycin resistance, which was acquired by
               participants in both arms of the study. Understanding these
               resistance dynamics is crucial to defining the public health
               drug resistance impacts of azithromycin prophylaxis given during

               genomic surveillance is critical to effectively manage this
               threat. We sought to systematically characterize CPE in
               Victoria, Australia, from 2012 to 2016. Suspected CPE were
               referred to the state public health laboratory in Victoria,
               Australia, from 2012 to 2016 and examined using phenotypic,
               multiplex PCR and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) methods and
               compared with epidemiological metadata. Carbapenemase genes were
               detected in 361 isolates from 291 patients (30.8\% of suspected
               CPE isolates), mostly from urine (42.1\%) or screening samples
               (34.8\%). IMP-4 (28.0\% of patients), KPC-2 (25.3\%), NDM
               (24.1\%), and OXA carbapenemases (22.0\%) were most common.
               Klebsiella pneumoniae (48.8\% of patients) and Escherichia coli
               (26.1\%) were the dominant species. Carbapenemase-inactivation
               method (CIM) testing reliably detected carbapenemase-positive
               isolates (100\% sensitivity, 96.9\% specificity), identifying an
               additional five CPE among 159 PCR-negative isolates (IMI and SME

               analysis; conversely, all patient pairs designated ``highly
               unlikely'' local transmission had $\geq$26 pairwise SNPs. Using
               this proposed threshold, possible local transmission was
               identified involving a further 16 patients for whom
               epidemiologic data were unavailable. Systematic application of
               genomics has uncovered the emergence of polyclonal CPE as a

              represent a major source of nosocomial infection worldwide. In
              Australia, there has been a recent concerning increase in
              bacteraemia associated with the vanA genotype, prompting
              investigation into the genomic epidemiology of VREfm. Methods: A
              population-level study of VREfm (10 November-9 December 2015) was
              conducted. A total of 321 VREfm isolates (from 286 patients)
              across Victoria State were collected and sequenced with Illumina
              NextSeq. SNPs were used to assess relatedness. STs and genes
              associated with resistance and virulence were identified. The
              vanA-harbouring plasmid from an isolate from each ST was
              assembled using long-read data. Illumina reads from remaining
              isolates were then mapped to these assemblies to identify their
              probable vanA-harbouring plasmid. Results: vanA-VREfm comprised
              17.8\% of isolates. ST203, ST80 and a pstS(-) clade, ST1421,
              predominated (30.5\%, 30.5\% and 37.2\%, respectively). Most
              vanB-VREfm were ST796 (77.7\%). vanA-VREfm were more closely
              related within hospitals versus between them [core SNPs 10 (IQR
              1-357) versus 356 (179-416), respectively], suggesting discrete
              introductions of vanA-VREfm, with subsequent intra-hospital
              transmission. In contrast, vanB-VREfm had similar core SNP
              distributions within versus between hospitals, due to widespread
              dissemination of ST796. Different vanA-harbouring plasmids were
              found across STs. With the exception of ST78 and ST796, Tn1546
              transposons also varied. Phylogenetic analysis revealed
              Australian strains were often interspersed with those from other
              countries, suggesting ongoing cross-continental transmission.
              Conclusions: Emerging vanA-VREfm in Australia is polyclonal,
              indicating repeat introductions of vanA-VREfm into hospitals and
              subsequent dissemination. The close relationship to global

              reaction is unidirectional and highly stable, vectors containing
              phage integrase systems have been used in a number of genetic
              engineering applications. Plasmids bearing the $\Phi$BT1

               cause resistance to rifampin (Rifr), a critical antibiotic for
               treatment of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus . In
               vitro studies have shown that RpoB mutations confer decreased
               susceptibility to other antibiotics, but the clinical relevance
               is unknown. Here, by analyzing 7,099 S. aureus genomes, we
               demonstrate that the most prevalent RpoB mutations promote
               clinically relevant phenotypic plasticity resulting in the
               emergence of stable S. aureus lineages, associated with
               increased risk of therapeutic failure through generation of
               small-colony variants (SCVs) and coresistance to last-line
               antimicrobial agents. We found eight RpoB mutations that
               accounted for 93\% (469/505) of the total number of Rifr
               mutations. The most frequently selected amino acid substitutions
               affecting residue 481 (H481N/Y) were associated with worldwide
               expansions of Rifr clones spanning decades. Recreating the
               H481N/Y mutations confirmed no impact on S. aureus growth, but
               the H481N mutation promoted the emergence of a subpopulation of
               stable Rifr SCVs with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin and
               daptomycin. Recreating the other frequent RpoB mutations showed
               similar impacts on resistance to these last-line agents. We
               found that 86\% of all Rifr isolates in our global sample
               carried the mutations promoting cross-resistance to vancomycin
               and 52\% to both vancomycin and daptomycin. As four of the most
               frequent RpoB mutations confer only low-level Rifr, equal to or
               below some international breakpoints, we recommend decreasing
               these breakpoints and reconsidering the appropriate use of
               rifampin to reduce the fixation and spread of these clinically
               deleterious mutations. IMPORTANCE Increasing antibiotic
               resistance in the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is
               threatening the ability to treat patients with these infections.
               Recent laboratory studies suggest that mutations in the gene
               commonly associated with rifampin resistance may also impact
               susceptibility to other last-line antibiotics in S. aureus ;
               however, the overall frequency and clinical impact of these
               mutations are unknown. By mining a global collection of clinical
               S. aureus genomes and by mutagenesis experiments, this work
               reveals that common rifampin-induced rpoB mutations promote
               phenotypic plasticity that has led to the global emergence of
               stable, multidrug-resistant S. aureus lineages that are
               associated with increased risk of therapeutic failure through
               coresistance to other last-line antimicrobials. We recommend
               decreasing susceptibility breakpoints for rifampin to allow
               phenotypic detection of critical rpoB mutations conferring low
               resistance to rifampin and reconsidering the appropriate use of
               rifampin to reduce the fixation and spread of these deleterious

              Of particular concern is the observation that resistance to

              isolates (cefixime MICs $\geq$ 0.12 mg/L, ceftriaxone MICs $\geq$
              0.06 mg/L). Only nine isolates had penA XXXIV genotypes, three of
              which had decreased susceptibility to ESCs (MIC = 0.12 mg/L).
              Azithromycin non-susceptibility was identified in 43 isolates
              (10.8\%); two of these isolates had 23S mutations (C2611T, 4/4

              re-assessment of risk factors for transmission may be warranted
              in this context. As elevated MICs of ESCs and/or azithromycin
              were found in closely related strains, targeted public health
              interventions to halt transmission are urgently needed.",

              transmission, and investigating the utility of genomics to
              enhance traditional field epidemiology for informing management
              of established widespread outbreaks. Methods: All KPC-producing
              Enterobacteriaceae isolates referred to the state reference
              laboratory from 2012 onwards were included. Whole-genome
              sequencing was performed in parallel with a detailed descriptive
              epidemiological investigation of each case, using Illumina
              sequencing on each isolate. This was complemented with PacBio
              long-read sequencing on selected isolates to establish
              high-quality reference sequences and interrogate characteristics
              of KPC-encoding plasmids. Results: Initial investigations
              indicated that the outbreak was widespread, with 86 KPC-producing
              Enterobacteriaceae isolates (K. pneumoniae 92\%) identified from
              35 different locations across metropolitan and rural Victoria
              between 2012 and 2015. Initial combined analyses of the
              epidemiological and genomic data resolved the outbreak into
              distinct nosocomial transmission networks, and identified
              healthcare facilities at the epicentre of KPC transmission. New
              cases were assigned to transmission networks in real-time,
              allowing focussed infection control efforts. PacBio sequencing
              confirmed a secondary transmission network arising from
              inter-species plasmid transmission. Insights from Bayesian
              transmission inference and analyses of within-host diversity
              informed the development of state-wide public health and

              intensive approach to screening contacts following new case

  abstract = "Public health agencies are increasingly relying on genomics
              during Legionnaires' disease investigations. However, the
              causative bacterium (Legionella pneumophila) has an unusual
              population structure, with extreme temporal and spatial genome
              sequence conservation. Furthermore, Legionnaires' disease
              outbreaks can be caused by multiple L. pneumophila genotypes in a
              single source. These factors can confound cluster identification
              using standard phylogenomic methods. Here, we show that a
              statistical learning approach based on L. pneumophila core genome
              single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) comparisons eliminates
              ambiguity for defining outbreak clusters and accurately predicts
              exposure sources for clinical cases. We illustrate the
              performance of our method by genome comparisons of 234 L.
              pneumophila isolates obtained from patients and cooling towers in
              Melbourne, Australia, between 1994 and 2014. This collection
              included one of the largest reported Legionnaires' disease
              outbreaks, which involved 125 cases at an aquarium. Using only
              sequence data from L. pneumophila cooling tower isolates and
              including all core genome variation, we built a multivariate
              model using discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC)
              to find cooling tower-specific genomic signatures and then used
              it to predict the origin of clinical isolates. Model assignments
              were 93\% congruent with epidemiological data, including the
              aquarium Legionnaires' disease outbreak and three other unrelated
              outbreak investigations. We applied the same approach to a
              recently described investigation of Legionnaires' disease within
              a UK hospital and observed a model predictive ability of 86\%. We
              have developed a promising means to breach L. pneumophila genetic
              diversity extremes and provide objective source attribution data
              for outbreak investigations.IMPORTANCE Microbial outbreak
              investigations are moving to a paradigm where whole-genome
              sequencing and phylogenetic trees are used to support
              epidemiological investigations. It is critical that outbreak
              source predictions are accurate, particularly for pathogens, like
              Legionella pneumophila, which can spread widely and rapidly via
              cooling system aerosols, causing Legionnaires' disease. Here, by
              studying hundreds of Legionella pneumophila genomes collected
              over 21 years around a major Australian city, we uncovered
              limitations with the phylogenetic approach that could lead to a
              misidentification of outbreak sources. We implement instead a
              statistical learning technique that eliminates the ambiguity of
              inferring disease transmission from phylogenies. Our approach
              takes geolocation information and core genome variation from
              environmental L. pneumophila isolates to build statistical models
              that predict with high confidence the environmental source of
              clinical L. pneumophila during disease outbreaks. We show the
              versatility of the technique by applying it to unrelated
              Legionnaires' disease outbreaks in Australia and the UK.",

              background of ST88 CA-MRSA isolates from Ghana and to describe in
              detail ST88 CA-MRSA isolates in comparison with other MRSA
              lineages worldwide. METHODS: We first established a complete ST88
              reference genome (AUS0325) using PacBio SMRT sequencing. We then
              used comparative genomics to assess relatedness among 17 ST88

              treatment centres in Ghana, three non-African ST88s and 15 other
              MRSA lineages. RESULTS: We show that Ghanaian ST88 forms a
              discrete MRSA lineage (harbouring SCCmec-IV [2B]). Gene content
              analysis identified five distinct genomic regions enriched among
              ST88 isolates compared with the other S. aureus lineages. The
              Ghanaian ST88 isolates had only 658 core genome SNPs and there
              was no correlation between phylogeny and geography, suggesting
              the recent spread of this clone. The lineage was also resistant

  abstract = "We tested the two main evolutionary hypotheses for an association
              between immunity and personality. The risk-of-parasitism
              hypothesis predicts that more proactive (bold, exploratory,
              risk-taking) individuals have more vigorous immune defenses
              because of increased risk of parasite exposure. In contrast, the
              pace-of-life hypothesis argues that proactive behavioral styles
              are associated with shorter lifespans and reduced investment in
              immune function. Mechanistically, associations between immunity
              and personality can arise because personality differences are
              often associated with differences in condition and stress
              responsiveness, both of which are intricately linked with
              immunity. Here we investigate the association between personality
              (measured as proactive exploration of a novel environment) and
              three indices of innate immune function (the non-specific first
              line of defense against parasites) in wild superb fairy-wrens
              Malurus cyaneus. We also quantified body condition, hemoparasites
              (none detected), chronic stress (heterophil:lymphocyte ratio) and
              circulating corticosterone levels at the end of the behavioral
              test (CORT, in a subset of birds). We found that fast explorers

              with the pace-of-life hypothesis, and with the previously

              There was no interactive effect of exploration score and duration
              in captivity on immune indices. This suggests that
              personality-related differences in stress responsiveness did not
              underlie differences in immunity, even though behavioral style
              did modulate the effect of captivity on CORT. Taken together

              effective strategy for alleviating inbreeding depression and
              boosting evolutionary potential. The helmeted honeyeater
              Lichenostomus melanops cassidix is a critically endangered
              subspecies of the common yellow-tufted honeyeater. Cassidix has
              declined to a single wild population of ~130 birds, despite being
              subject to intensive population management over recent decades.
              We assessed changes in microsatellite diversity in cassidix over
              the last four decades and used population viability analysis to
              explore whether genetic rescue through hybridization with the
              neighbouring Lichenostomus melanops gippslandicus subspecies

              cassidix population is characterized by low genetic diversity and

              vulnerable to inbreeding depression and will have limited

              flow (~4 migrants per generation) from gippslandicus into

              three continents in a globally invasive bird, the monk parakeet
              (Myiopsitta monachus). We evaluated whether genetic diversity at
              invasive sites could be explained by (i) the native source
              populations from which they were derived and (ii) demographic
              bottlenecks during introduction. Genetic data indicated a
              localized source area for most sampled invasive populations, with

              on demographic connectivity, a challenging parameter to measure.
              With genomics as a new tool, fisheries managers can detect
              signatures of natural selection and thus identify fishing areas
              likely to contribute evolutionarily compatible colonizers to an
              overfished area (i.e. colonizers that are not at a fitness
              disadvantage in the overfished area and able to reproduce at
              optimal rates). Identifying evolutionarily compatible stocks
              would help narrow the focus on establishing demographic
              connectivity where it matters. Here, we genotype 4723 SNPs in 616
              orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) across five fishing areas
              off the Tasmanian coast in Australia. We ask whether these areas
              form a single genetic unit, and test for signatures of local
              adaptation. Results from amova, structure, discriminant analysis
              of principal components, BAYESASS and isolation by distance
              suggest that sampled locations are subjected to geneflow amounts
              that are above what is needed to establish 'drift connectivity'.
              However, it remains unclear whether there is a single panmictic
              population or several highly connected populations. Most
              importantly, we did not find any evidence of local adaptation,
              suggesting that the examined orange roughy stocks are
              evolutionarily compatible. The data have helped test an
              assumption of the orange roughy management programme and to
              formulate hypotheses regarding stock demographic connectivity.
              Overall, our results demonstrate the potential of genomics to

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Understanding the forces that shaped Neotropical
              diversity is central issue to explain tropical biodiversity and
              inform conservation action; yet few studies have examined large,
              widespread species. Lowland tapir (Tapirus terrrestris,
              Perissodactyla, Tapiridae) is the largest Neotropical herbivore
              whose ancestors arrived in South America during the Great
              American Biotic Interchange. A Pleistocene diversification is
              inferred for the genus Tapirus from the fossil record, but only
              two species survived the Pleistocene megafauna extinction. Here,
              we investigate the history of lowland tapir as revealed by
              variation at the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome b, compare it to
              the fossil data, and explore mechanisms that could have shaped
              the observed structure of current populations. RESULTS: Separate
              methodological approaches found mutually exclusive divergence
              times for lowland tapir, either in the late or in the early
              Pleistocene, although a late Pleistocene divergence is more in
              tune with the fossil record. Bayesian analysis favored mountain
              tapir (T. pinchaque) paraphyly in relation to lowland tapir over
              reciprocal monophyly, corroborating the inferences from the
              fossil data these species are sister taxa. A coalescent-based
              analysis rejected a null hypothesis of allopatric divergence,
              suggesting a complex history. Based on the geographic
              distribution of haplotypes we propose (i) a central role for
              western Amazonia in tapir diversification, with a key role of the
              ecological gradient along the transition between Andean subcloud
              forests and Amazon lowland forest, and (ii) that the Amazon river
              acted as an barrier to gene flow. Finally, the branching patterns
              and estimates based on nucleotide diversity indicate a population
              expansion after the Last Glacial Maximum. CONCLUSIONS: This study
              is the first examining lowland tapir phylogeography. Climatic
              events at the end of the Pleistocene, parapatric speciation,
              divergence along the Andean foothill, and role of the Amazon
              river, have similarly shaped the history of other taxa.
              Nevertheless further work with additional samples and loci is
              needed to improve our initial assessment. From a conservation
              perspective, we did not find a correspondence between genetic
              structure in lowland tapir and ecogeographic regions proposed to
              define conservation priorities in the Neotropics. This
              discrepancy sheds doubt into this scheme's ability to generate
              effective conservation planning for vagile species.",

               species that does not exhibit life history traits typically
               associated with colonizing species (e.g., high reproductive rate
               or long-distance dispersal capacity). To investigate this
               apparent paradox, we examined individual and population genetic
               patterns of microsatellite loci at one native and two invasive
               sites. More specifically, we aimed at evaluating the role of
               propagule pressure, sexual monogamy and long-distance dispersal
               in monk parakeet invasion success. Our results indicate little
               loss of genetic variation at invasive sites relative to the
               native site. We also found strong evidence for sexual monogamy
               from patterns of relatedness within sites, and no definite cases
               of extra-pair paternity in either the native site sample or the
               examined invasive site. Taken together, these patterns directly
               and indirectly suggest that high propagule pressure has
               contributed to monk parakeet invasion success. In addition, we
               found evidence for frequent long-distance dispersal at an
               invasive site (∼100 km) that sharply contrasted with previous
               estimates of smaller dispersal distance made in the native range
               (∼2 km), suggesting long-range dispersal also contributes to the
               species' spread within the United States. Overall, these results
               add to a growing body of literature pointing to the important
               role of propagule pressure in determining, and thus predicting,
               invasion success, especially for species whose life history
