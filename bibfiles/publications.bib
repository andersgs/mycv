  abstract  = "Staphylococcus epidermidis is a significant opportunistic
               pathogen of humans. Molecular studies in this species have been
               hampered by the presence of restriction-modification (RM)
               systems that limit introduction of foreign DNA. Here, we
               establish the complete genomes and methylomes for seven
               clinically significant, genetically diverse S. epidermidis
               isolates and perform the first systematic genomic analyses of
               the type I RM systems within both S. epidermidis and
               Staphylococcus aureus Our analyses revealed marked differences
               in the gene arrangement, chromosomal location, and movement of
               type I RM systems between the two species. Unlike S. aureus, S.
               epidermidis type I RM systems demonstrate extensive diversity
               even within a single genetic lineage. This is contrary to
               current assumptions and has important implications for
               approaching the genetic manipulation of S. epidermidis Using
               Escherichia coli plasmid artificial modification (PAM) to
               express S. epidermidishsdMS, we readily overcame restriction
               barriers in S. epidermidis and achieved electroporation
               efficiencies equivalent to those of modification-deficient
               mutants. With these functional experiments, we demonstrated how
               genomic data can be used to predict both the functionality of
               type I RM systems and the potential for a strain to be
               electroporation proficient. We outline an efficient approach for
               the genetic manipulation of S. epidermidis strains from diverse
               genetic backgrounds, including those that have hitherto been
               intractable. Additionally, we identified S. epidermidis BPH0736,
               a naturally restriction-defective, clinically significant,
               multidrug-resistant ST2 isolate, as an ideal candidate for
               molecular studies.IMPORTANCEStaphylococcus epidermidis is a
               major cause of hospital-acquired infections, especially those
               related to implanted medical devices. Understanding how S.
               epidermidis causes disease and devising ways to combat these
               infections have been hindered by an inability to genetically
               manipulate clinically significant hospital-adapted strains.
               Here, we provide the first comprehensive analyses of the
               barriers to the uptake of foreign DNA in S. epidermidis and
               demonstrate that these are distinct from those described for S.

               approach for the genetic manipulation of S. epidermidis to
               enable the study of clinical isolates for the first time.",

  abstract = "Abstract The accurate identification of conservation units is
              central to effective management strategies. However, marine
              environment populations often have large census sizes and few
              obvious boundaries to gene flow. Poorly understood species in the
              deep sea are especially at risk of being erroneously managed as a
              single interbreeding stock (panmictic). However, mistaking
              cryptic structure for panmixia can have important consequences
              leading to ineffective management and population decline.
              Furthermore, characteristics of populations essential for their
              survival may reflect local adaptation, not evident from surveys
              using neutral genetic markers. We use genomic methodologies to
              test hypotheses about potential drivers of cryptic population
              structure among marine fish populations in the deep sea. In
              particular, we consider the possibility of isolation by distance
              along habitat corridors for a species dependent on a specific
              depth range and test for differentiation at functional loci
              across potential ecological habitat boundaries. For a species
              previously understood to be panmictic in the North Atlantic, we
              reveal neutral genetic differentiation among regional populations
              isolated by distance along deep-water channels. We also reveal a
              distinct pattern of cryptic genetic structure for putative
              functional loci, despite apparently high levels of gene flow.
              Synthesis and applications. This example reflects the life
              history and ecology of a broad range of deep-sea species
              currently exploited in intensive fisheries or as bycatch. In many
              cases where these populations are managed as a single stock, more
              effective management could be achieved using the methods we
              describe to identify relevant eco-evolutionary processes,
              facilitated by genomic methods, permitting the recognition of
              cryptic stock structure. This approach also allows managers to
              more directly promote the essential but elusive conservation of
              adaptive potential.",
